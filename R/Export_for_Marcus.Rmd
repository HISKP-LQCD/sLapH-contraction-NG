Marcus Petschlies has implemented a similar projection code. We want to compare our results. For this we need to export the results obtained via Mathematica in a common format.

His suggestion is the following format:

This basically is just a flat version of the 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
total_momentum_d <- c(0, 0, 1)
irrep <- 'E'
```
